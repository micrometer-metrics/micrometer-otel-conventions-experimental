= Micrometer-Observation-Conventions

This module is an implementation of OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions.
We have copied over the necessary code from https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/ and reused the OpenTelemetry Java semantic convention attributes and resources code generating scripts.

The code has been adopted a bit but its main authors are the OpenTelemetry authors.
